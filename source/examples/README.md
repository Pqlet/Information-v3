# Experiments

This folder consists of several Jupyter notebooks with MI estimation experiments.

List of conducted experiments with synthetic data:
- Trivial tests (normal and uniform distributions) [link](<./Mutual Information tests (no compression).ipynb>)
- Rasterised images of 2D-gaussians (diagonal covariance matrix): [link](<./Mutual Information tests (gaussian).ipynb>)
- Rasterised images of 2D-gaussians: [link](<./Mutual Information tests (gaussian, correlated).ipynb>)
- Rasterised images of rectangles: [link](<./Mutual Information tests (rectangles).ipynb>)

List of conducted experiments with DNNs:
- DNN classifier of MNIST dataset: [link](<./Information plane experiments (DNN classifier).ipynb>)

Necessary utils and NN architectures can be found in the [`misc` directory](./misc).
